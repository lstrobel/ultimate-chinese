# How to add words to this deck

The source of truth for the deck is `res/words.json`. This file contains all the information about the words in the deck. It is structured as a list of notes, each with a set of fields. To add or modify a note, you should edit this file.

Currently, the only way to add words is to edit this file directly. In the future, I hope to add a more user-friendly way to do this. When adding words, please follow the [card content guidelines](CARD_CONTENT_GUIDELINES.md) to ensure consistency.
