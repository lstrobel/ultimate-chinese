## How to study with this deck

This deck is designed to be flexible, whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced learner. Below are two recommended workflows for studying with this deck.

### Workflow 1: For Beginners

If you are new to Chinese, the easiest way to start is to go through the cards in the default order.

The cards are sorted to loosely follow the TOCFL and HSK vocabulary levels, providing a logical progression from more common and fundamental words to more advanced ones. This allows you to build a solid vocabulary base from the ground up.

### Workflow 2: For Self-Directed Learners

If you are following a specific textbook, curriculum, or are learning through immersion, you may prefer to learn words as you encounter them. The recommended method for this is to:

1. **Suspend all cards** in the deck.
2. **Unsuspend cards selectively** as you encounter new vocabulary.

You can find words to unsuspend in a few ways:

- **Using Tags:** The deck is tagged by TOCFL and HSK levels (e.g., `UC::TOCFL-1`). You can use the Anki browser to find and unsuspend all cards for a specific level.
- **Searching:** As you encounter new words in your lessons or in the wild, search for them in the Anki browser and unsuspend them individually.

This approach allows you to tailor the deck to your personal learning journey.

### A Note on Sentence Mining

Sentence mining is a popular and effective language learning technique that involves creating flashcards from sentences you encounter in native materials.

While this deck does not yet have a dedicated sentence mining workflow, the "Self-Directed" method above is a great way to approximate it by learning words you find during your immersion. In the future, I hope to add features that better support a full sentence-mining workflow while leveraging the deck's existing content and styling.

### Contributing to the Deck

This deck is a community project, and contributions are highly encouraged. While it contains a large vocabulary, there are still gaps to be filled. If you'd like to add words, please follow the instructions in `HOW_TO_ADD_WORDS.md` (currently a work in progress). Your contributions will help make this a better resource for all learners.

## Recommendations on how to answer cards in Anki

### What to grade yourself on

The cards in this deck contain a lot of information. There are often multiple words, multiple pronunciations, and multiple meanings. Select a subset of the information to focus on, and grade yourself on just that. Stay consistent: always grade yourself on the same part of the card.

When I study, I check whether I got the top Standard pronunciation correct, or the Taiwanese pronunciation if there is one. I ignore the other pronunciations. I also grade myself on getting at least one of the main meanings correct, but I don't worry about getting all of them.

### How to grade yourself

When you see a card, you have four options: Again, Hard, Good, and Easy.

1. In alignment with the official Anki advice, remember that "Hard" means you got the card correct. Don't use "Hard" to mean "I got most of it right."
2. "Easy" is fairly ambiguous, so press it at your own discretion. I press it when it's a word I encounter so often in daily life that I really don't need to study it again, but I don't want to delete it from my deck.

## Study tips in general

This section is for people completely new to language learning. Hopefully, I can introduce you to some basic concepts that will help you get started.

1. To make real progress, flashcards are not enough. You need to be doing something else with the language, whether that's reading, listening, speaking, or writing. Flashcards are a way to make sure you remember the words you encounter in those other activities.
2. The most effective way to learn a language is widely accepted to be *immersion*: thatâ€™s just spending time with the language in such a way that you are forced to use it. People argue about the best forms of immersion and what kind of immersion to do first, etc. But the reality is much simpler: the more time you spend doing *anything* in the language, the better. So pick something you like and do it a lot.
3. In my experience, if everything else in your routine falls away, flashcards can still keep you moving forward. So, rather than ever giving up on your deck, try your best to reduce your daily reviews to the minimum tolerable amount and never stop.
4. For Chinese specifically, you cannot neglect learning tones. Some people say you do not need them; that is false. More ambiguous is the necessity of learning to read and write characters. I think it is possible to get by without learning to write, as you can often get away with a pinyin keyboard, but you should learn to read.
