# Anki: Ultimate Chinese

An attempt to make a complete and comprehensive Mandarin Chinese study deck for Anki, inspired by [Ultimate Geography](https://github.com/anki-geo/ultimate-geography).

Currently focused on Taiwanese Mandarin, but I do plan to expand to support learners focused on Mainland Mandarin as well.

If you have any suggestions or concerns, please leave an issue.

## Getting Started

To add the deck, follow these steps:

1. Install the [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki) addon for Anki.
2. Download the latest release from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lstrobel/ultimate-chinese/releases).
3. Extract the downloaded archive.
4. Open Anki and go to `File` > `CrowdAnki: Import from disk`.
