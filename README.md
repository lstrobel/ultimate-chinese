# Anki: Ultimate Chinese

An attempt to make a comprehensive Mandarin Chinese vocab study deck for Anki, inspired by [Ultimate Geography](https://github.com/anki-geo/ultimate-geography).

Currently focused on Modern Standard Mandarin as spoken in Taiwan (國語), but I do plan to expand to support learners focused on the Mainland (普通话) as well.

If you have any suggestions or concerns, please leave an issue!

## Getting Started

### Adding the Deck to Anki

To add the deck, follow these steps on Anki Desktop:

1. Install the [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki) addon.
2. Download the latest release of this deck from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lstrobel/ultimate-chinese/releases).
3. Extract the downloaded archive.
4. Open Anki and go to `File` > `CrowdAnki: Import from disk`.
5. Study!

### Updating the Deck

To update the deck with the latest changes, you only need to re-import it using the same steps as above.

However, pay close attention to the version number of the release you are importing. Changes in the major or minor version (e.g., from 1.x.x to 2.x.x or from 1.2.x to 1.3.x) may include significant changes to the deck's structure or content, which could affect your existing cards. Read the release notes carefully to understand what you might need to do.

> [!CAUTION]
> Any changes you made to the field values of existing cards (e.g., adding tags, modifying definitions) will be overwritten when you reimport the deck. However, your review history and scheduling data will remain intact.

### How to Use This Deck
