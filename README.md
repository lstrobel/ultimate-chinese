# ultimate-chinese

An attempt to make a complete and comprehensive Chinese study deck for Anki, inspired by [Ultimate Geography](https://github.com/anki-geo/ultimate-geography). 

Currently focused on Taiwanese Mandarin, but the long-term plan is to support all languages that classify under the "Chinese" umbrella. 

If you have any suggestions or concerns, please leave an issue.
